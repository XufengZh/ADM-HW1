# ADM-HW1
In the homework1, we need to submit these 2 files as mentioned in Homework PDF file.

- The pdf file that you created. 
- The Python code of your solutions, clearly organized.

In my Github repository, Allsubmission_PDF.pdf is submission proof that created in *https://www.hackerrank.com/submissions/all*.

All Python code was put into the ADM_HW1.ipynb. I organize the order, and you can see it clearly. For your convenience, I also create a PDF file of code which named "ALL Code PDF.pdf", you can preview my code by click it.

If you have any other questions of my homework, you can contact me by gmail\<zhangxufeng1998@gmail.com\>  or \<xufeng_zhang@qq.com\>.

*Because I am a first year student of Data scienceï¼ŒI don't have an institutional email. So I do my homework with my personal gmail address.
